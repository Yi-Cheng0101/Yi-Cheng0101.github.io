                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Yi-Cheng Hsiao. With a background in software engineering and computer graphics, I specialize in real-time rendering, neural rendering, graphics programming, computer animation simulation, and 3D math. I consistently integrate technology and art to enhance the entertainment experience.</p>
                
                <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                <p>I previously worked at HTC VIVE as a Graphics Software Engineer. During this time, I researched and developed technologies for real-time streaming and VR rendering applications. One of the projects I engaged in involved developing VBS (VIVE Business Streaming), a streaming software in C++ and DirectX, which enables wireless or VIVE cable streaming of PC VR content from the computer to the VR headset and reduces the heavy rendering workloads.</p>

                <p>I was a Research Assistant in the Intelligent Geometric and Visual Computing (IGVC) Lab at Texas A&M University. My focus was on neural rendering and 3D Gaussians Splatting. This project had a strong research orientation, and I utilized 3D Gaussians Splatting techniques and photorealistic representations to generate 3D human avatars.</p>

                <p>I was also a Research Assistant in the Soft Interaction Lab, developing interactive media art and XR applications. There, I tested Igloo, a 360-degree projector, to visualize an immersive environment project using Unity and Touch Designer, and used Meta Quest3 and Hololens2 to create XR prototypes.</p>

                <h3>Academic Background</h3>
                <p>I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Visualization from Texas A&M University, specializing in computer graphics. My coursework includes ray tracing, global illumination, real-time rendering, and programming, which has deepened my understanding of real-time rendering and computer graphics. Additionally, my research includes developing a 3D photorealistic Gaussian Splatting Avatar controlNet for single video generation of 3D human avatars and modifying human motion via skeleton controlling.</p>

                <p>I studied Computer Science at National Tsing Hua University, specializing in computer graphics and high-performance computing. My courses included physically based simulation, graphics programming application, and linear algebra. Moreover, I attended many Student Supercomputer competitions around the world, including ASC, ISC, and HPC-AI.</p>
