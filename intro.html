            <p>Hello, my name is Yi-Cheng Hsiao</p>
            <p>With a background in software engineering and Computer Graphics, I specialize in 
                real-time rendering, neural rendering, graphics programming, computer animation simulation, 
                and 3D math. I consistently integrate technology and art to enhance the entertainment experience.</p>
            
            <p>Professional Experience</p>
            <p>I previously worked at HTC VIVE as a Graphics Software Engineer. 
                During this time, I researched and developed technologies for real-time 
                Streaming and a VR rendering application. One of the projects I engaged in 
                involved developing VBS(VIVE Business Streaming), a streaming software in C++ and 
                DirectX, which enables wireless or VIVE cable streaming of PC VR content from the 
                computer to the VR headset and reduces the heavy rendering workloads.</p>

            <p>I was a Research Assistant in Intelligent Geometric and Visual Computing (IGVC) Lab at Texas A&M University. 
                My focus was on neural rendering and 3D Gaussians Splatting. This project had a strong research orientation, 
                and I utilized 3D Gaussians Splatting techniques and photorealistic representations to generate 3D human avatar.</p>

            <p>I was also a Research Assistant in Soft Interaction Lab and developing interactive media art and XR applications. There, 
                I tested Igloo, a 360 degrees projector to visualize an immersive environment project using Unity and Touch Designer. And 
                use Meta Quest3 and Hololens2 to create XR prototypes.</p>

            <p>Academic Background</p>
            <p>I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Visualization from Texas A&M University, specializing in Computer Graphics. 
                My coursework includes ray tracing, global illumination, real-time rendering, and programming, which has deepened my understanding 
                of the real-time rendering and computer graphics. Additionally, my research includes developing a 3D photorealistic Gaussian Splatting 
                Avatar controlNet for single video generate 3D human avatar and modify the human’s motion via skeleton controlling.</p>

            <p>I studied Computer Science at National Tsing Hua University, specializing in computer graphics and high performance computing. 
                My courses included physically based simulation, graphics programming application and linear algebra. Moreover,  I attend many 
                Student Supercomputer competitions around the world, ASC, ISC and HPC-AI.
